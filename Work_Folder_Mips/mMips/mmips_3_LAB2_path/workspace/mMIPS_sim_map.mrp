Slice Logic Distribution:
  Nummber of MUXCYs used:                      104 out of  13,644    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        2,146
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         1,602 out of   2,146   74%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 239 out of   2,146   11%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         305 out of   2,146   14%
    Number of unique control sets:              11
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              30 out of  54,576    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
